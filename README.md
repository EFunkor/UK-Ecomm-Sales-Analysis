## PROBLEM STATEMENT
    ***This project relates to the United Kingdom only

A leading retail company has reached out to us to help them make some data-driven decisions to help grow and differentiate their business. As part of this need, the CEO of the company has shared some of their transactional data to help with this discovery process. He has questions about what types of items should be placed close together on shelves for shelf optimization, some major items that should be ordered ahead of time, a forecast of revenue for the next year, what type of items should they run promotions on, and why. Heâ€™ll also appreciate any additional data-driven insights you can share to give them a competitive edge.

## OBJECTIVE

    1. Identify optimal product placements on shelves to improve sales and customer experience.
    2. Determine major items that should be ordered in advance to maintain inventory efficiency.
    3. Forecast the company's revenue for the upcoming year.
    4. Recommend types of items for promotional activities and provide the reasoning behind these recommendations.
    5. Offer additional data-driven insights to help the company gain a competitive advantage in the market.
